# tsDice | Desktop Wallpaper Edition

[Link to hosted copy](https://desktop.tsdice.pages.dev/)

Welcome to the **Desktop Wallpaper Edition of tsDice**, a special version optimised for a rich, persistent, and interactive background experience on your computer.

This isn't just a randomiser; it's a powerful engine for creating your perfect, evolving desktop scene. It leverages the robust physics of the [tsParticles](https://github.com/tsparticles/tsparticles) library to turn your background into a dynamic work of art.

## âœ¨ Desktop Edition Features

This version includes exclusive features designed specifically for a desktop environment:

* **Persistent Scenes with "Save":** The star of the show! Find a look you love, hit the **Save** button, and it will automatically become your default scene every time your computer starts. No more losing that perfect vibe.
* **Advanced Physics Engine:** The randomisers are supercharged with complex physics to create endlessly fascinating scenes. Watch particles `infect` each other with new colours, get pulled in by `attraction`, `spin` in place, or `absorb` each other on collision.
* **Automatic Day/Night Theme:** On its very first run, the wallpaper will automatically select a light or dark theme based on your local time of day. You can always override it manually.
* **Resource Management:** A dedicated **Pause/Play** button allows you to freeze the animation at any time, instantly reducing CPU/GPU usage when you need to focus on a demanding task.
* **Deep Customisation:**
    * **Granular Shufflers:** Randomise Appearance, Movement, Interaction, and Special FX independently.
    * **Chaos Level:** Use the slider to control the scene's complexity, from a calm, minimalist flow to a chaotic swarm.
    * **Toggles:** Instantly enable or disable gravity, cursor trails, and particle lifespans.
