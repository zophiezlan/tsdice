Built on the powerful [tsParticles](https://github.com/tsparticles/tsparticles) library, this tool allows you to generate, tweak, and share an endless variety of particle "scenes" right in your browser.

Whether you're looking for inspiration for a web project or just want a mesmerising visual experience, the Scene Randomiser has you covered.

## Features

* **Instant Randomisation:** Generate a complete, unique particle animation with a single click.
* **Granular Control:** Shuffle specific aspects of the animation, including:
    * **Appearance:** Particle shape, size, colour, and stroke.
    * **Movement:** Speed, direction, gravity, and trails.
    * **Interaction:** How particles react to your mouse on hover and click.
    * **Special FX:** Effects like links, rotation, wobble, and collisions.
* **Share Your Creation:** Generate a unique, compressed link that saves your entire scene configuration. Share it with friends or save it for later!
* **Intensity Scale:** A 1-10 slider to control the overall chaos and complexity of the random effects.
* **Interactive Toggles:** Fine-tune the scene with dedicated toggles for common settings like theme, cursor particle trails, particle lifespan, and gravity.
* **Helpful UI:** Get instant feedback with custom tooltips explaining every control and on-screen notifications for actions like copying a link.
* **History & Fullscreen:** Step back through your last 20 shuffles with the "Back" button, and enter an immersive, distraction-free view with the fullscreen toggle.
* **Responsive Design:** A clean, glassmorphism-style UI that works beautifully on both desktop and mobile.
