## Features

* **Instant Randomisation:** Generate a complete, unique particle animation with a single click.
* **Granular Control:** Shuffle specific aspects of the animation, including:
    * **Appearance:** Particle shape, size, colour, and stroke.
    * **Movement:** Speed, direction, gravity, and trails.
    * **Interaction:** How particles react to your mouse on hover and click.
    * **Special FX:** Effects like links, rotation, wobble, and collisions.
* **Intensity Scale:** A 1-10 slider to control the overall chaos and intensity of the random effects.
* **Interactive Toggles:** Fine-tune the scene with toggles for common settings like theme, cursor focus, and particle death.
* **History:** Made a change you don't like? The "Back" button lets you step back through your last 20 shuffles.
* **Responsive Design:** A clean, glassmorphism-style UI that works beautifully on both desktop and mobile.
